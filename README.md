Generate a computer persona for OTWOW with this Processing tool!

Fixed stuff:
1. There's no need for a draw loop; everything can be done in a for loop in setup().
2. Output can be put into a folder.
3. Best to use global variables intead of local ones in Processing.
4. Fiddled with HSB to get better (I think) computers.
